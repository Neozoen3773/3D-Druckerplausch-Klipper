# 3D-Druckerplausch-Prusa-MK3-Klipper
Repo for config file(s) for Prusa MK3(S)(+) with Klipper

Please see the wiki for advanced information how we set up Klipper on our Prusa printers.

This repository is meant in general for the Prusa MK3(S)(+) with Klipper.
We try to collect here first of all working and complete configurations and these have been build up in a modular way so it would be easy to add or remove something or when we add a specific config for a specific part you wont need to modify your configuration but just include it in your original configuration.

We are still in a setup process but we try to document as much as possible.

The Wiki will be a main guideline on how to flash but also explanations how certain parts work.

# ToDo

- Klipper Setup on Raspberry and Prusa
- Restore Prusa firmware
- Config file description and how includes work
